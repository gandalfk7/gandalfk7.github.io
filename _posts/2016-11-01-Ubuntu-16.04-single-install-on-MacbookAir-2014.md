title: Ubuntu 16.04 single install on MacbookAir 2014
---

NB: these are notes for my particular installation, YMMV


Installation:
"burn" the image on the usb stick, I tend to use usb-creator-gtk on ubuntu, some say dd-ing the image on the usb is ok,
insert the usb key on your applething, power on and press opt/alt: ![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2016-11-01-Ubuntu-16.04-single-install-on-MacbookAir-2014/Screenshot-from-2016-11-02-22-49-46.png)
then select "EFI boot" and go on with the installation


Keyboard:
this is the holy grail: https://github.com/free5lot/hid-apple-patched
it permits you to finally swap the "fn" and "ctrl" keys.

###install:

    git clone https://github.com/free5lot/hid-apple-patched
    cd hid-apple-patched
    sudo dkms add .
    sudo dkms build hid-apple/1.0
    sudo dkms install hid-apple/1.0

edit the config file:

    sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf

add:

    options hid_apple fnmode=2
    options hid_apple swap_fn_leftctrl=1
    options hid_apple swap_opt_cmd=1

apply and reboot:

    sudo update-initramfs -u
    sudo reboot

alternatively you can follow this guide, without the swapping of "fn" and "ctrl": https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppleKeyboard

INTERRUPTS:
a big performance problem I found was with ACPI interrupts,
find the problematic ones:

    grep . -r /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/

if you an interrupt with thousands of calls, you can try to disable it,
BE AWARE THAT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN

    sudo echo "disable" > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpeXX

source: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBook#kworker_using_high_CPU

add it as a systemd service:

    nano /etc/systemd/system/suppress-gpeXX.service

add:

    [Unit]
    Description=Disables GPE XX, an interrupt that is going crazy on Macs

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'echo "disable" > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpeXX'

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

enable it on boot:

    sudo systemctl enable suppress-gpeXX

test it:

    sudo systemctl start suppress-gpeXX

and check it has actually disabled the gpe:

    cat /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpeXX

you should now read "disabled",
it is better to test also a reboot.

POWER TUNING:

install powertop and run it:

    sudo apt-get install powertop
    sudo powertop --auto-tune

TODO: add it as a system service on startup

install TLP:

    sudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw

source: http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-linux-advanced-power-management.html#installation


GRUB TUNING:

follow: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookAir6-2/Trusty#Finetuning_Powersave_functionsTODO: add steps


BACKLIGHT and SUSPEND:

one issue is that the backlight does not automagically switch on after suspend/hibernate,
follow this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookAir6-2/Trusty#Backlight

HIBERNATE:

    sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla

add:

    [Re-enable hibernate by default in upower]
    Identity=unix-user:*
    Action=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate
    ResultActive=yes

    [Re-enable hibernate by default in logind]
